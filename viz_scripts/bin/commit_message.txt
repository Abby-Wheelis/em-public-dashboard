Load read_json_resource() from e-mission-common

- Pass labels instead of dynamic_labels to the notebooks
- labels can either be:
      - Custom labels from the program deployment config, from nrel-openpath-deploy-configs
      - In case, we do not have custom labels for the program/study, load default labels from e-mission-common with read_json_resource
